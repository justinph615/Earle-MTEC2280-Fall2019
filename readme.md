## Course Description
An introduction to interactive technology with a focus on how we use technology to express ourselves and interact with our environment. This class combines a hands-on exploration of basic components of media, audio, and control circuits. Students also develop interfacing technologies from simple switches to multidimensional sensors, integrated circuits, and micro-controllers. Emphasis will also be placed on communicating between physical and digital systems.

## Learning Outcomes
+ Program basic visual applications in Processing
+ Recognize and use appropriate terminology for electrical systems and theory.
+ Measure Voltage and Resistance of components and circuits
+ Recognize and use correct symbols on a circuit diagram
+ Program micro-controllers
+ Build control circuits with analog and digital components

##  Texts

+ Schiffman, Daniel. Learning Pocessing, 2nd Edition
+ Banzi, Massimo. Getting Started with Arduino, 3rd Edition
+ Collins, Nicolas. Handmade Electronic Music, 1st Edition

## Expectations
+ Arrive on time and attend all classes—see below for attendance policy.
+ Spend at least 2-4 additional hours a week (outside of class) on class projects, readings, playing games & writing in game journal.
+ Check GitHub for assignments and materials (typically announced and posted at the end of class on Mondays).
+ Check Slack regularly for group and private messages.
+ Actively participate in class discussions & group critiques.
+ Back up your work regularly.
+ Follow good device etiquette: No cell phone use during class. Laptops
only used for lecture note-taking and related class activities.
+ Thoughtfully contribute to a positive classroom environment, while actively supporting and challenging your classmates’ ideas.
+ Push yourself creatively and technically. Be ambitious. Work hard. Stay open and curious!

## Communication
+ To contact your instructor with a brief, private question or message, send a DM (Direct Message) through Slack.
+ If you have a question that may be relevant to the group (about homework, etc.), post in the #general channel on Slack for all to see and comment on.
+ Use Slack for easy communications with your classmates as well—you can DM individuals or selected groups.
+ To discuss a longer matter with your instructor, DM to set up an appointment for office hours.

## Attendance Policy
+ Students are expected to attend every class, arrive on time, and actively engage/participate.
+ If you will be absent, or if you are running late, DM your instructor ASAP.
+ In the case of an absence, contact a classmate for notes and what you missed, check OpenLab for assignments, and contact the instructor if you have additional questions.
+ Lateness and absences will impact your grade. Worse, not showing up will impact everyone else in the class. As most of our projects are collaborative, we are dependent on everyone’s presence and full participation.
+ All in-class activities are graded for participation. Unexcused absences will result in a 0 for participation for the day.
+ Unexcused lateness counts as 1/3 absence when up to 25 minutes late, 1/2 absence when 26-50 minutes late, and a full absence beyond that point.
+ Absences may be excused in the following cases: documentation of illness provided by a doctor, religious observance with advance notice, official school-related activity (with documentation and advanced notice), and on a case-by-case basis for other critical events.
+ Project critiques are mandatory and cannot be made up. Missing a critique will result in a deduction of one letter grade for the corresponding project.

## Academic Integrity Standards
Students and all others who work with information, ideas, texts, images, music, inventions, and other intellectual property owe their audience and sources accuracy and honesty in using, crediting, and citing sources. As a community of intellectual and professional workers, the College recognizes its responsibility for providing instruction in information literacy and academic integrity, offering models of good practice, and responding vigilantly and appropriately to infractions of academic integrity. Accordingly, academic dishonesty is prohibited in The City University of New York and at New York City College of Technology and is punishable by penalties, including failing grades, suspension, and expulsion. The complete text of the College policy on Academic Integrity may be found in the catalog.

Instructor Note: Code borrowed from another source at more than four lines in length must be attributed as a //comment within the code itself. If you are unsure of whether or not your work may constitute plagiarism, please check with your instructor before submitting.
